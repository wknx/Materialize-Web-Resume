# Materialize Web Resume
A resume template based on Material Design

Hey you, this is my first repo here on Github and how you can see it is a simple but nice **resume webpage**.
It is made with pure **[Materialize framework](http://materializecss.com/)**, so if you don't know what it is you should take a look at its page before edit, but it's pretty easy, shouldn't take long to understand the css syntax. :)

E-mail sender
-------
Don't forget to edit the **[mail.php](mail.php)** so the formulary works properly to send you contact emails. It was originally settled to work for "Locaweb", a brazilian host service.
